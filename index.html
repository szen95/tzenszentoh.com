        <h3>Hi, I'm Szen.</h3>

        <p>I grew up in Malaysia. Iâ€™m an Academic Foundation Doctor based at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals in the UK. My
            research
            interests lie at the intersection of cancer biology and computation.</p>

        <p>I started teaching myself how to build software in my first year of med school.</p>

        <p>Supervized by Dr. Dennis Wang at Sheffield's <a href="http://trans-bioinformatics.com"
                target="_blank">Translational
                Bioinformatics Group</a>, I have worked on differentiating the drug response of cancer cell lines using
            unsupervised machine learning
            and also establishing the relationship between drug response and uncertainty estimated from Gaussian
            Processes from
            published high-throughput drug screens.</p>

        <p>Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://davelab.org" target="_blank">Dave Lab</a> at Duke University to
            develop mobile applications for annotating cancer genomic variants. I received clinical research training
            at the <a href="https://www.uhncombiel.com" target="_blank">Princess
                Margaret Cancer Centre</a> in Toronto.</p>

        <p>I've also worked at the <a href="http://www.rnai.group.shef.ac.uk" target="_blank">Sheffield RNAi Screening
                Facility</a> and the <a href="https://www.monash.edu.my/jcsmhs/research/brims" target="_blank">Brain
                Research Institute Monash Sunway</a> on topics including long non-coding RNAs and gene editing.</p>

        <p>On the side, I co-founded the MedTech Sheffield society and led it as President for 2 years. I led my team to
            twice organize the <a href="http://hackmed.uk" target="_blank">HackMed hackathon</a>.
            If you're interested in my work, please <a href="contact.html">reach out to me</a>!</p>
